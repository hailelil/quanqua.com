# Deployment Alternatives for GoDaddy

If your GoDaddy cPanel doesn't have Node.js support, here are your options:

---

## üöÄ Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (RECOMMENDED - EASIEST)

This is the fastest and easiest way to deploy your Next.js app with GoDaddy domain.

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Production ready Quanqua app"

# Create repository on GitHub.com and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/quanqua.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. Sign up or log in with GitHub
3. Click **"Add New Project"**
4. Import your `quanqua` repository
5. Click **"Deploy"** button
6. Wait 2 minutes - your site is live!

### Step 3: Connect Your GoDaddy Domain

1. In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain: `quanqua.com`
4. Vercel will show you DNS instructions

### Step 4: Update DNS in GoDaddy

1. Log into **godaddy.com**
2. Go to **My Products** ‚Üí **DNS**
3. Update your DNS records:

   **Option A: Point Root Domain (quanqua.com)**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: [Get IP from Vercel dashboard]
   TTL: 600
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   TTL: 600
   ```

   **Option B: Use CNAME** (if GoDaddy supports it)
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   TTL: 600
   ```

4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
5. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables in Vercel

1. In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**

## üîß Option 2: Use GoDaddy's Web Hosting with Custom Setup

If you must use GoDaddy hosting:

### Check Your Hosting Type

1. Log into GoDaddy
2. Check what type of hosting you have:
   - **Shared Hosting**: Only supports PHP/static files
   - **Managed WordPress**: Only WordPress
   - **cPanel**: May support PHP only
   - **VPS/Dedicated**: Can install Node.js yourself

### If You Have Shared Hosting

You have two choices:

#### A. Export as Static Site

Build a static export and upload HTML files:

```bash
# Add to next.config.ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
};

# Build
npm run build

# This creates an 'out' folder
# Upload the 'out' folder contents to public_html
```

**Note**: This won't work for translation API calls (API routes)

#### B. Use Vercel + Point Domain (Best Option)

Go with Option 1 above - it's much easier!

---

## üåê Option 3: Use Netlify (Alternative to Vercel)

Similar to Vercel but different provider:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to **netlify.com**
3. Import repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy
6. Point your domain to Netlify

---

## üí° Option 4: Upgrade GoDaddy Hosting

If you want to use GoDaddy with Node.js:

1. **Upgrade to VPS or Dedicated Server**
2. **Contact GoDaddy Support** to enable Node.js
3. **Ask them** if they can enable Node.js on your current plan

## üÜò Need Help?
