# Deploy via GoDaddy File Manager (Static HTML Only)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitation

If you upload via File Manager to basic GoDaddy hosting, the **translation API will NOT work** because:
- Basic hosting only supports static HTML/PHP files
- Your app needs Node.js to run the translation API
- The API routes (`/api/translate`) require a server

## Option 1: Static Export (HTML Only - Translation Won't Work)

If you still want to try this approach:

### Step 1: Create Static Export

Update `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export', // This creates static HTML files
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an `out` folder with static HTML files.

### Step 2: Upload via File Manager

1. Log into GoDaddy cPanel
2. Click **"File Manager"**
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder
4. Delete any existing files in `public_html`
5. Upload all contents from the `out` folder
6. Done!

**Problem**: Translation won't work because there's no backend server.

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use Vercel Instead

# If not initialized, run:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready Quanqua app"

# Create repo on GitHub.com, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quanqua.git
